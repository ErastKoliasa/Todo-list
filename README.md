# Todo-list

The program was created using HTML, CSS, and JS.
You can write your name in a special input field.
Then you can write a list item in another input field, select a category for the item (personal or business).
By clicking the "Add Todo" button, the list item that was entered in the input field will be displayed on the page.
Each item in the list can be edited, deleted, and marked as completed.
All data is stored in local storage, so when the page reloads, it will be saved.
